1. run command 'selltousdt'
    This command checks the balance of the account, and sells any asset that is not USDT into USDT. 
    This allows the trading system to have a fresh start.

2. run command 'updatebalance'
    This command checks the balances(accountinfo), grabs the USDT balance, and sets that as the starting balance of the live trading system. 
    That means that any balances in other cryptos are ignored(there technically shouldn't be any after selltousdt)
    This command will eventually have to run automatically over some predetermined interval, but this will have to do for now.

3. run command 'start'
    This will start the main trading loop, and the trading system should begin to trade.
