This is an unofficial manual for running Jane. 

_Starting sequence_
0. choose from a or b. 
0a. run command 'selltousdt'
    This is to start from scratch, and sells all assets back into USDT. Commission will apply, and this is only for a blank slate. 

0b. run command 'fetchvars' 
    If a var_files.txt exists, and is populated, this can be used to start the program with a predefined state(what algorithms are in a play, etc.). 

AUTO(a)): 
1. run command 'autostart'
    This should take care of everything, unless you really know what you're doing. In that case, feel free to read the alternate commands down below 
    and run the appropriate ones. 

MANUAL: 
1. run command 'fetchpredata'
    This command fetchs previous data required for the initialization of the system. In other words, it fetches the past max_lookback worth of data 
    to give to the algorithms for the generation of signals. Hence called "predata."

2. run command 'start'
    This will start the main trading loop, and the trading system should begin to trade. 


_Ending sequence_
1. run command "storevars" 
    This command will store the program state in a text file to retrieve later. This means that the program doesn't have to sell out to USDT and restart.
