next problem

leftover values / fixing how the program deals with spare cash

solutions
1. manual variable setting system? 
	one size fits all but very inefficient and not pretty
	already implemented
2. command to redistribute funds
3. continuously update cash reserves
	each loop, multiply price by amount in currency 
	and add to usdt to calculate "notional" portfolio value
	

position sizing

for every buy signal, get the relative split of the algorithm compared to total split of the free algorithms

so ex.

A  B  C  D  E
10 20 5 25 40

Example #1 
How to divide in USDT
say A and C are not in a play. 
A generates a buy signal. 
10/(10+5) = .66, so .66 of the free USDT balance would go to the signal that A generated.

This example generalizes to all currencies. The next example illustrates this.  

Example #2
say B and D are in a play in the same currency(say ETH as an example).


Program structure

kline_valid {
	for i in signals:
		if signal is different:
			fetch account information
			get account split
			buy that much
}
