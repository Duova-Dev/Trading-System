ohlc_history: a 3D vector of type f64. 

    This is the vector holding the necessary OHLC data for all the algorithms to run. 
    The shape is a, b, 10, where a = number of tickers to keep track of and b = number of minutes of lookback(assuming each row of ohlc is a minute long).
    OHLC structure(Marked with - are used fields. The rest are padded with -1s for now.):
